I am a Software Engineer living in the Bay Area. 

I love to netflix and chill most of my time away. Occasionally, I am traveling, hiking, reading, writing a blog OR sipping whisky.

<!-- TODO(hmit): Replace the following comment by 12/31/2019. -->

I am trying to improve my writing skills and hence this blog. I'll be using this space to write about code, living in the US of A, whiskeys I have tried, and more.
