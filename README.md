# About me

I am a Software Engineer living in the Bay Area. 

I love to netflix and chill most of my time away. Occasionally, I am traveling, hiking, reading, writing a blog OR sipping whisky.

I am trying to improve my writing skills and hence this blog. I'll be using this space to write about code, living in the US of A, whiskeys I have tried, and more.

# About this project
I have been meaning to maintain a blog for a while now and using my current downtime to set it up and kick-start it with a few posts. Hopefully, it doesn't just become a forgotten-by-author shout box into the ether that internet is and stays maintained.
