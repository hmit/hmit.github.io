title: Moving to 'murica!
---

I decided to move to the US of A sometime in 2013. I asked my friends around for referral and browsing the monthly "Who is hiring?" posts on Hacker News.
It all came to fruition in March 2014 when Divyam referred me to MyLikes Inc, a small 10-person startup and after a couple of interviews with Arvind, I was sent an offer letter. 

The next step was to get through the infamous H1B lottery, with 1-in-3 odds at the time. We were on a strict timeline for the April 1 deadline, as we only had 15 days to get all the documents in order. Anyway, it all worked out in the end and I gave notice on my current job. 

One thing I wanted to do, before leaving, was meet my very big family. It was a lot of fun catching up with my aunts and cousins.
