title: Privacy Concerns
---

The wordpress.com is not helping me. Everytime I login, I’ve to spend good 5 minutes reloading the page before I can start writing. I think I’ll have to set up a command line posting mechanism or do something similar. More about that later.

So, over the course of my internet presence I’ve gone a little cautious about my privacy; what I share, who I share with and stuff. The reason is primarily the fear of having too much public information about me. A bunch of lawyers some day might dig up something stupid I did in high school or college and held it against me in a court of law (We all can remember the The Social Network, Eduardo Saverin [incident](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Social_Network#Eduardo_Saverin)) or pull a [TakeThisLollipop](https://www.takethislollipop.com/) on me. Paranoid or not, I have stopped sharing photos on facebook and will take down my picasa photos in some time. Most of them are already taken away. I’m also quite worried about a lot of data being in the hands of companies like Google, Facebook and Akamai (you didn’t see this one coming). One day a certain entity decides to do an online profiling on me or a background check and find out about my raunchy night near the Boat House or about the Ponzi scheme I ran when I was 16. I don’t want any such thing to held against me. Since prevention is the best defense I avoid all of such stuff to ever get into public. Hell, I’m these days being very cautious about swearing and sharing stuff on groups as well.

But with all these precautionary measures, I let Google collect my Web History, let Facebook build my Web Surfing log (from cookies) and post things on blogs (like this one). I have at times thought so much about deleting the Web History and discontinuing the service. I even came close once or twice only to leave things the way they are right now. This is primarily because of the possibility of some future use of such a functionality (like in case of InfoAxe where people are voluntarily submitting such data and also registering for it and downloading a toolbar). Only tonight, I wanted to look up my query earlier from today and I realised how treacherous the water i’m in, is right now. I can’t switch these off completely because I’m too lazy or incapable to remember (depends upon the time) my earlier query. Why dig up all the papers and notes, when you can simply log in and navigate/search for the relevant query. Better still, just type in related words and google will show your previous query as the top result.

With the online tracking in case of Facebook, it is completely different rationale. You are on Facebook because nothing is good enough. Google+ is sort of there but not everybody likes it and very few want to switch to it fully and abandon Facebook; so the latter has an edge over there. It is sort of a monopoly which can control what it wants to do and how it wants to do it. People can either do their way or go kid themselves.

There is one very important reason to not care about all this. These sites have proven time and again that they can be trusted with user’s data, that they won’t let it fall in wrong hands barring a few individual cases unlike many other secure sites. You can be sure that as long as these sites don’t themselves share this data, your secrets are pretty safe with them.

But is that enough? Thinkers and Supporters have already argued that the Internet usage comes at the cost of privacy and that certain amount of privacy concern has to be given up to make use of the internet as we do. It is for this reason, people don’t mind themselves being profiled for online ads, personalized search or even stumbleUpon.

Random Thought: Sometimes I feel internet users to be just lab rats in a spinning wheel inside this big laboratory with internet biggies as experimenters. They work on a feedback from the rat to decide the good for the community; and the sad part is we, the rats, feel good about it and fight over the success of different experiments.
