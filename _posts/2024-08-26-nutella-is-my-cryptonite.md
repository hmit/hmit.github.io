## Nutella is my kryptonite

I first discovered Nutella when my dear friend Amogh bought it in the second year of college from D-Mart on one of our "grocery" shopping trips. It was yum-at-first-bite. The slightly bitter, rich flavor of hazelnut combined with magic that is cocoa, it's hard to resist. Health and fat be damned, we bought small jars that were gone in a few weeks.

Thankfully for my health, we stopped buying in our 3rd year and I graduated college unscathed and fat only on bread-butter vs butter _and_ Nutella.

With an abundance of money as I started working, I found better sources for my unhealthy-calorie budget (term coined retrospectively of course) like beer, flower; Nutella took a back seat.

That followed a period of biking, healthy eating, and weight loss that I'm still proud of 10 years later and Nutella was all but forgotten. I'd shy away from the aisle, not meeting it eye-to-eye on my trips to Total mall and then eventually Safeway.

Until recently...

...when I found small to-go packets at a breakfast buffet in an NYC hotel. I picked them up under the pretense of encouraging my son to finish them. But I was only fooling myself that my salad eating, butter loving, and ice-cream hating son would even look at them, much less eat them.

So not to let them go to waste and happy on the inside, I opened the first one, followed by second, followed by another; not stopping until all were gone. Next morning, ashamedly, I allowed myself to pick-up a few Nutellas, for myself: only two this time, I told myself. But they are so small and the trip has all but ended, I sheepishly grabbed two more with a sleight of hand that surprises me even to this day (Sorry Yashi!). I happily plopped all of them, my son sitting on the next table all but forgotten when it comes to Nutella.

Well, I thought it ended there but I have since start seeing Nutella everywhere‚Äîin the mall, Safeway, Costco*, and even my office during breakfast ü§¶.

I'm hooked though: nutella mixed with greek yogurt‚Äîumm yum yum! I'm calling it *nutyo*. I should quit it regardless!

‚Äî
I promise I'll quit it... 
...starting tomorrow

PS: Blessed is Costco for selling 2 really big-ass jars on Nutella that even I hesitate to buy becaue I find them too big to finish until the next trip!
PS1: While searching for Nutella images, I remembered about those few breadsticks + Nutella combos that I've helped to myself when nobody was looking at various places.
