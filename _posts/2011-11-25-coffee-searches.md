title: Coffee and Google Searches
---

If you don’t know already, my last post came when I was surfing through my Google Web History (GWH) data. As I was navigating, I thought more about the calendar and the searches on the right hand side of the window. It is a color coded graph of an estimate of the number of Google queries I made on that specific day. So far I have made around 15k Google searches over a period of two years averaging to 21 queries a day meaning drinking 21 cups of coffee as some people like to see it (I want to get a coffee machine badly). The GWH also helps me clearly identify my project submission and deadline days and my holidays or black out days. The number of queries went as high as 160 a day on some days with March and November being the busiest followed closely by the summer months (I had my internship then). Now, I remembered reading various posts about the energy footprint of Google and wanted to substantiate every data in this post with a link. Though I couldn’t find the link to the coffee statistics, I found [this](https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/efficiency/#water-and-cooling) and [this](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/energy-and-internet.html).

While the former talks about the Google’s energy footprint as estimated by Google Engineers, the latter talks about the technologies and energy conservation techniques that go into building the secretive Data Centers Google owns.
If you look at the first link (mind you this is approx. two years old), you notice that the engineers don’t talk about the energy spent outside the Google ecosystem i.e. they don’t consider the energy consumed by your laptops, various network routers and in data transmission making the actual energy a little higher. You’ll also notice that when CO2 emissions are looked at on a daily basis they look quite astonishing but on per capita basis they are quite reasonable. I think this kind of analysis and the desire to advertise themselves as eco-friendly and the need to do things differently has prompted Google to setup the second link where they talk about the cooling mechanisms and alternative sources in use at their data centers. Facebook also has something similar though more obscured and they have come up with a design which does not require a lot of air-conditioning to keep their servers and disks cool.
