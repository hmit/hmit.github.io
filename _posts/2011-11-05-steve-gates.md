title: Jobs and Gates
---

The recent death of Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc. and his upcoming biography has let the cat out of the bag. It has opened up a lot of aspects of Jobs’s life that didn’t make their way into the public. The much talked about stuff in the book over [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) and elsewhere has been about Jobs’s legacy and the company he envision Apple to be. Another thing that has been quite talked about is his dislike for Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft Corp. He accused Gates of stealing ideas and technology from others and selling them off as their own, thereby making him an unimaginative person. Gates’s response to this was that he (Jobs) must have found it difficult to sell his premium priced products and seeing Gates selling goods in high volume must have been tough for him. Both of them must have been correct in their reactions and certainly people might argue that Jobs is no saint either or Gates be overlooked for the philanthropy he is doing right now. But, I like to see it from a different perspective.

At one point, Jobs seeing his end near worries a lot about his company, his legacy. Why should not he? He has changed the way people enjoy music, talk or chat. He has created a fan following for his products and that too at a company that threw him out once. He’s a great believer in new ideas and constantly tries to push the technology forward. So far so good. But what really strikes me is the fact that he, near his death, would say something like that1 about his competitor and contemporary. I think of it as an outburst for someone who did equally good. He always must have felt jealous seeing MS’s progress over Apple. He doesn’t gain anything from such a statement; he’s dead. So why now? Why does he want to go down in the history as a man who bore hatred for his competitor. A statement like this would only tarnish his image and so would Gates’s. On one’s deathbed you talk nice things about others; resolve all but unresolved conflicts. Did he really want this to be his legacy? I’m not quite sure of that.

Jobs, in my view, is one who follows My way or the high way and bears ill-will against all those who try to reach masses instead of only the elite. That is clearly reflected from Apple’s marketing strategy of its products; Jobs’s dislike for [Dell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs#Management_style) , Microsoft and Google are well known publicly. The fact that he bears his hatred and feeling for revenge for this long really disgusts me.

Edit: Read this article at The New Yorker a couple of days later. A good one, relevant to the blog. Do check it out. http://goo.gl/yHRct
