A nice surprise and idea from valve software (remember portal, DOTA, half-life) was revealed to me today. They are planning to launch a game based on Economics and money making. While the idea is not novel it is some serious idea. Not wasting any further time, I ask you to google valve and yanis varoufakis and read comments in hacker news
