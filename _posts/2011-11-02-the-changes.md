title: The changes
---

For the past couple of months, my online identity underwent severe changes and none of them were a result of my actions but rather the websites that control my online avatar, namely Google and Facebook. They have been so eager to roll out new products and UI changes that people are finding it hard to keep track at times. The last of the changes came today when I woke up to the new GMail look. This new modification is what triggered this post. Normally, I don’t care blogging about UI and functionality changes but this is different. It has changed the very thing where I spent most of my online time.

The first change in the series was Google+, which looked promising and the next facebook. Google also invested heavily in the idea by making sure that their other products viz. Search, Mail, Docs, Reader are in tune with the new product. Following the Google’s way, Facebook quickly pushed new UI changes to protect it’s user base1. While the changes made by Facebook looked good, Google’s changes seemed crude and attempting to mimic the minimalistic design. They removed or obscured out certain important features from docs, didn’t add the page navigation properly and started wasting a lot of space on the top. The font size in the theme suddenly grew bigger and more in the face. Something similar happened with Reader as well. See [here](http://brianshih.com/78073742). And now when changes were made to GMail, I can’t decide exactly if I should appreciate the design or point out the flaws. With this post I think I’ll do both.

## The Good

First of all, they have done a nice job  integrating GMail UI changes to that of G+. The new conversation view is simply amazing. There are less buttons everywhere. The search box has advanced search options built right inside it2. The priority switch for mails can now be easily toggled and doesn’t need you to go places. The hidden labels also come and go if you hover and unhover (my design) the area. The square like feel and the new themes are just too good to resist. The themes are now more uniform and span over the entire page than just the left and the center region. The page overall gives a nice visual and clutter free feeling.
Of course, that being sad, I’m not completely happy with the changes. There are many things they could have done to have improved the design. Although I have to credit that they have done an awesome job against the preview they rolled out a couple of weeks ago.

## The Bad

The first thing you notice is the clear demarcation of your mail, chat and left widgets. There are different scroll bars for each of them. This means a lot of scroll bars on your web page and it is especially troublesome when you have to scroll something in one of your widgets. With this respect, I liked the previous design a lot.
Then there is this wastage of the top space by increased use of font sizes and whitespace.

The conversations are now more compact than earlier and especially with right-side chat (look at the image). Also, the star is now to the right3. The mail details now look weird and large for the space, so does older conversations in a thread4 (now they are longer than a line)

 

Also on the main page, the attachment icon seem to occupy too much space and the bangs and exotic stars don’t really look good in the square shape. The contacts are now two clicks away instead of one3. And my the biggest problem with the design is the now present horizontal bar for the central region. That space is only because the settings button and the navigation. I think that to be utterly useless especially given that you already have so much empty space in that area (to the left). Oh and I almost forgot the chat. The contacts and their status messages now share the same typography (no difference like bold there or color change) making it a little bit confusing.

To end, I think this is still the first draft and lot will change in coming days or weeks. Maybe, they fix the horizontal scrolling issue and chat contacts issue sooner and work on the space management again to give an even more richer experience.

1 Note here that some of the changes they did must have been in the pipeline before G+ was launched but the timing was too perfect to be a coincident.

2 Though I hardly every felt that the need to use the advanced search options explicitly.

3 thank goodness I use keyboard shortcuts

4 But that might be the result of incorporating photos in the conversations.

PS: I just noticed the wordpress full screen editing page and it is good.
