## Daycare
My son goes to a home based daycare in our neighborhood and it's an amazing place for him.
His teacherâ€”teacher Lilyâ€”runs it like a school and has an annual graduation party for kids moving to kindergarten. It is a potluck with all the parents invited and to celebrate all the kids moving up to kindergarten (or pre-k). This is followed by a week of summer break! Ofc, it's bit stressful to think about having to work and t2 home during those hours. He needs constant companion.

## Ideas
For this one, we had a bunch of ideas but nothing materialized like,
1. Travel with Yashi's brother-in-law to either Vegas or Orlando.
2. An all-day weeklong camp like arts or chess or something.
3. Split taking care of t2 on weekdays so that each of us can get some work done and attend meetings. 

However, last minute, we realized that Yashi is super busy preparing her QBRs. She won't be able to travel or split the days. It was too late to make camp reservations with just a week to go.

## The week
This offered an amazing opportunity for Guneesh and I to travel together or do things locally. Travel felt stressful esp. with last minute planning and in hindsight was a great decision to skip on.

We went to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Santa Cruz beach, Ardenwood Historic Farm, numerous trips to my office, and various libraries around the bay area. Not to mention we biked to numerous parks in the neighborhood and he ate well, slept easy, and hopefully thoroughly enjoyed this week. I know I did! I also found time to catch-up with friends.

I'm ending the week feeling very satisfied with a whole lot more stories to tell than I'd ever remember. Definitely looking forward to the next opportunity when I get to do this again. Yes, the work suffered and hope I'm able to catch up on it next week.

To son and father exclusive time!!

PS: Thanks Yashi for help around the house and watching over him post-lunch Tuesday so I could attend those meetings.
