title: Happy Anniversary Sweetue!
---

I can't imagine it's been seven married years together! It hasÂ been an up-and-down journey but it's been ours. You know you are difficult to shop for or surprise. A bigger issue is my anniversary celebration game has not been at par.

This is the year of copper/wool for warmth [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_anniversary#cite_ref-15). Here's my interpretation of the warmth and affection I have for you! To celebrating in a more public way!
