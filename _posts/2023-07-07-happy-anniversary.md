title: Happy Anniversary Sweetue!
---

I can't imagine it's been seven married years together! It has been an up-and-down journey but it has been uniquely ours. A bigger issue is my anniversary celebration game has not been at par.

This is the year of copper/wool for warmth per [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_anniversary#cite_ref-15). I had been wracking my brain on an appropriate gift to mark the occasion. However, you know you are difficult to shop for OR surprise. And so, I thought a post flipping bits in the digital realm to be preserved for eternity would be the way to express my warmth and affection for you.

To celebrating in a more public way — Happy Anniversary honey-bunny!

❤️ Harshit
