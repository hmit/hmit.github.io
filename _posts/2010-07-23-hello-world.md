title: Hello world!
---

The most familiar phrase in the CS community though it has many manifestations but the idea remains the same — _“I am out in the world”_ or _“hey! I can write in this language”_. Anybody who has ever done programming must have come across this phrase at some point of his/her life.


Like the Cadbury advertisement: _“koi bhi shubh karya karne se pahle, kuch meetha ho jaaye.”_ Every programmer writes a “Hello World!” program in the language he is learning. (There are a certain programming languages in which HW! is not possible or should come at a later stage, but that’s not the point.)


This thing is so much into me (it is wannabe, but can’t help it) that I normally write a hello world post. This in some way, also let me overcome my excitement of using/developing the new thing.
