Hello World, son!

After persistent efforts from my wife in convincing me to have kids, we were blessed with our son, Guneesh Mittal (t2) on Feb 11. He's our cute little bundle of joy that has brought the two of us immense joy. I wanted to take a moment to mark the occasion and welcome him to the world CS style.

I'll probably revisit this post and add more content.
