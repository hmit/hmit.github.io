## About Me
I am a Software Engineer living in the Bay Area. 

I love to netflix and chill most of my time away. Occasionally, I am traveling, hiking, reading, writing a blog OR sipping whisky.

I am trying to improve my writing skills and hence this blog. I'll be using this space to write about code, living in the US of A, whiskeys, and more.

You can reach me at [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshitmittal/) OR [twitter](https://twitter.com/hmittal83).

## About this project

I have been meaning to maintain a blog for a while now and using my current downtime to set it up and kick-start it with a few posts. Hopefully, it doesn't just become a forgotten-by-author shout box into the ether that internet is and stays maintained.
